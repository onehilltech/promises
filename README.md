Promise library for JVM and Android

* Implements the [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/) specification from JavaScript
* Built using Java 1.7, but designed for Java 1.8
* Supports Java Lambda expressions
* Android module allows resolve/reject callbacks to run on UI thread


## Installation

> This library requires Java 1.8

### Gradle

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" 
      // https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html#sec:repository-content-filtering
      content {
          // filter only artifacts with group "com.onehilltech.promises" for https://github.com/onehilltech/promises
          includeGroup "com.onehilltech.promises"
      }
    }
}

dependencies {
  // for JVM-only projects
  compile 'com.onehilltech.promises:promises-jvm:x.y.z'
  
  // for Android projects (includes JVM automatically)
  implementation 'com.onehilltech.promises:promises-android:x.y.z'
}
```

## Quick Start

The simplest promise to create is one that is already resolved or rejected using
`Promise.resolve` or `Promise.reject`, respectively.

```java
// resolved promise
Promise.resolve (5);

// rejected promise
Promise.reject (new IllegalStateException ("This is a rejected promise"));
```

You can also create a promise that is settled in the background. This is good when you need to 
perform some workload in the background, and notify the caller (or client) when the workload
is resolved or rejected.

```java
Promise <Foo> p = new Promise < > (settlement -> {
  // settlement.resolve (foo);
  // settlement.reject (ex);
}); 
```

In this case, you must either invoke `settlement.resolve` with the resolved value, or
`settlement.reject` with an exception. Any uncaught exceptions will automatically reject
the promise with the uncaught exception.

All promises are executed (or settled) when they are first created. To process
a promise's settlement, use either `then` or `_catch`. It does not matter when you
call `then` or `_catch`. If the promise is not settled, then the appropriate
handler will be called after the promise is settled. If the promise is settled,
then the appropriate handler will be called as soon as possible. 

> **Important.** All handlers are executed on a separate thread.

```java
Promise.resolve (5)
       .then (n -> {
         // n == 5
         System.out.println ("Resolved value: " + n);
         return null;
       });

Promise.reject (new IllegalStateException ("This is a rejected promise"))
       ._catch (reason -> {
         // reason instanceof IllegalStateException
         reason.printStackTrace ();
         return null;
       });
```

You may notice that the handlers return `null` in the example above. This is because the
handler has the option of returning a value or a `Promise` that to used to resolve the value 
for the next handler in the chain. If the handler does not a value or a `Promise`, then 
`null` is passed to the next handler.

```java
Promise.resolve (5)
       .then (n -> {
         // n == 5
         System.out.println ("Resolved value: " + n);
         return value (10);
       })
       .then (n -> {
         // n == 10
         System.out.println ("Resolved value: " + n);
         return null;
       });
```

Not all handlers will return a value or `Promise`. If you are in this situation, then you can use
the `ResolveNoReturn` and `RejectNoReturn` helper classes, or `resolved` and `rejected` helper
methods.

```java
import static com.onehilltech.promises.Promise.resolved;
import static com.onehilltech.promises.Promise.rejected;

// ...

Promise.resolve (5)
       .then (resolved (n -> System.out.println ("Resolved value: " + n)))        // n == 5
       ._catch (rejected (reason -> reason.printStackTrace ()));
```

### Chaining Promises

Promises can be chained to create a series of background workloads to be completed in
step order. Just use `then` to chain a series of background workloads, and `_catch` to
handle any rejection from the preceding promises.

```java
Promise.resolve (5)
       .then (resolved (n -> System.out.println ("Resolved value: " + n)))          // n == 5
       .then (resolved (value -> System.out.println ("Resolved value: " + value)))  // value == null
       ._catch (rejected (reason -> { }))
       .then (this::doSomethingElse)
       ._catch (Promise.ignoreReason);
```

In the example above, we must point our several things. First, execution continues
after the first `_catch` if any of the preceding promises is rejected. If none of
the promises are rejected, then the first `_catch` is skipped. Second, we are using
Java method references (i.e., `this::doSomethingElse`), which improves the readability
of the code, and reduces verbosity. Lastly, `Promise.ignoreReason` is a special 
handler that will catch the rejection and ignore the reason. This way, you do not have
to write a bunch of empty handlers like the first `_catch`.

### Await

JavaScript introduced a concept called async/await for serial execution of promises. The
main idea the caller of `await` blocks until the promises is settled. The advantage of this
approach is it makes promise code more readable because it removes promise chaining. We
provide a similar with this library, and it is simple to use. Below is example code that
uses the `await` function to serialize promise execution.

```java
import static com.onehilltech.promises.Promise.await;

// ....

try
{
  int result = await (Promise.resolve (5));
}
catch (Exception e)
{
  
}
```

The `await` function takes a `Promise`. The caller of the `await` function will block
until the promise is settled (i.e., resolved or rejected). If the promise is resolved,
it will return the resolved value. If the promise is rejected, it will throw the reason
for rejection.

### Promise.all

The library implements `Promise.all`, which is resolved if **all** promises are resolved 
and rejected if **any** of the promises is rejected.

### Promise.race

The library implements `Promise.race`, which is settled when the first promise is either 
resolved or rejected.

## Android Support

### Running on the UI Thread

All promises are settled on a background thread, and the handlers are called on a background
thread. If you attempt to update the UI in the handler, then the Android framework will throw
an exception. This is because you are updating the UI on a different thread than the one that
create the UI elements (i.e., the main thread). To address the need for updating the UI in
the handler methods, the Android module provides `onUiThread` helper methods for running a 
handler on the UI thread.

```java
import static com.onehilltech.promises.Promise.resolved;
import static com.onehilltech.promises.Promise.rejected;
import static com.onehilltech.promises.RejectedOnUIThread.onUiThread;
import static com.onehilltech.promises.ResolvedOnUIThread.onUiThread;

// ...

Promise.resolve ("Hello, World!")
       .then (onUiThread (resolved (str -> this.label.setText (str))))
       ._catch (onUiThread (rejected (reason -> reason.printStackTrace ())));
```


Happy Coding!
